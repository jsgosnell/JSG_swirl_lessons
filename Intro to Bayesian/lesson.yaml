  Output: Welcome to Swirl! This interface will help review some of the code we've used in class.Note if you give the wrong answer you may get hints, but swirl may also think calling required packages is a "wrong answer", so you can ignore any feedback when that happens.

- Class: text
  Output: Today we'll review the methods used to analyze continuous data from one population.  In this case we are comparing the value we observed for some parameter (usually the mean) to a value we set under the null hypothesis.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: For most of these tests we can input data as an object (like a column of a dataframe or a list we have created) or by typing it in manually in the function arguments.   We'll practice using a subset of our data on Australian athletes.  Load the data from the web-based file using sport <- read.table("http://www.statsci.org/data/oz/ais.txt", header = T, stringsAsFactors = T).
  CorrectAnswer: sport <- read.table("http://www.statsci.org/data/oz/ais.txt", header = T, stringsAsFactors = T)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='sport <- read.table("http://www.statsci.org/data/oz/ais.txt", header = T, stringsAsFactors = T)')
  Hint: Use sport <- read.table("http://www.statsci.org/data/oz/ais.txt", header = T, stringsAsFactors = T). Note you are reading a tab delimited file so you use read.table and specify it has a header (since the default is false).

- Class: text
  Output: Good job.  Note you read a tab delimited file so you used read.table and specified it has a header (since the default is false).

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now let's focus on the subset of men that run the 400m dash.  Create an object called male_400m that contains this subset using male_400m <- sport[sport$Sex == "male" & sport$Sport == "T400m",]
  CorrectAnswer: male_400m <- sport[sport$Sex == "male" & sport$Sport == "T400m",]
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='male_400m <- sport[sport$Sex == "male" & sport$Sport == "T400m",]')
  Hint: Use male_400m <- sport[sport$Sex == "male" & sport$Sport == "T400m",]. Note you are making a new object from the sport dataframe that has all rows where Sex = male and Sport = T400m.

- Class: text
  Output: Great. Remember what the notation you used means.  You made a new object from the sport dataframe that has all rows where Sex = male and Sport = T400m.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Finally, we can take a Bayesian approach to the question.  The ttestBF function (in the BayesFactor library) provides support for the null or alternative models.  Load hte package then run the function - it has the same arguments as t.test!
  CorrectAnswer: ttestBF(x = male_400m$Ht, mu = 175.6)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='ttestBF(x = male_400m$Ht, mu = 175.6)')
  Hint: Try ttestBF(x = male_400m$Ht, mu = 175.6)


- Class: mult_question
  Output: Great. The output provides a Bayes Factor. What is it?
  AnswerChoices: 2.93; 1.25; 0.52
  CorrectAnswer: 2.93
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='2.93')
  Hint: Look after the colon!

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Great. A Bayes Factor of greater than 1 supports the alternative, and less than 1 supports the null. What does our output suggest?
  AnswerChoices: support null; support alternative; not sure
  CorrectAnswer: support alternative
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='support alternative')
  Hint: Is the Bayes Factor greater or less than 1?

- Class: text
  Output: Good job.  The magnitude of the Bayes Factor also indicates the strength of support (see lecture slides for a scale)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: This swirl lesson will build directly on our lesson for dealing with one sample of continuous data.  Although most of the functions we'll employ allow you to input data manually or in two groups, we'll focus on using the formula interface to manipulate data from dataframe.  We'll focus on Australian athlete data again.  Load the data from the web-based file using sport <- read.table("http://www.statsci.org/data/oz/ais.txt", header = T, stringsAsFactors = T)
  CorrectAnswer: sport <- read.table("http://www.statsci.org/data/oz/ais.txt", header = T, stringsAsFactors = T)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='sport <- read.table("http://www.statsci.org/data/oz/ais.txt", header = T, stringsAsFactors = T)')
  Hint: Use sport <- read.table("http://www.statsci.org/data/oz/ais.txt", header = Tread.table("http://www.statsci.org/data/oz/ais.txt", header = T, stringsAsFactors = T)). Note you are reading a tab delimited file so you use read.table and specify it has a header (since the default is false).

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Finally, we can take a Bayesian approach to the question.  The ttestBF function (in the BayesFactor library) provides support for the null or alternative models, but sometimes its has issues with sample size or formula interface.  You can instead get a 2-sample t-test Bayes factor from http://pcl.missouri.edu/bf-two-sample.  Go there now and input the data you need.  To get the t-test value, re-run our t-test with the water polo and 400 m data (t.test(Ht ~ Sport, male_400m_wpolo).
  CorrectAnswer: t.test(Ht ~ Sport, male_400m_wpolo)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='t.test(Ht ~ Sport, male_400m_wpolo)')
  Hint: Try t.test(Ht ~ Sport, male_400m_wpolo).

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Then use the summary command to find sample sizes for each group. 
  CorrectAnswer: summary(male_400m_wpolo)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='summary(male_400m_wpolo)')
  Hint: Try summary(male_400m_wpolo).

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Hit enter to get the Bayes Factor. What is it?
  AnswerChoices: 297; 1.25; 0.52
  CorrectAnswer: 297
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='297')

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Great. A Bayes Factor of greater than 1 supports the alternative, and less than 1 supports the null. What does our output suggest?
  AnswerChoices: support null; support alternative; not sure
  CorrectAnswer: support alternative
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='support alternative')
  Hint: Is the Bayes Factor greater or less than 1?

- Class: text
  Output: Good job.  The magnitude of the Bayes Factor also indicates the strength of support (see lecture slides for a scale)
  
  
- Class: text
  Output: Finally, let's think about tests where we have paired samples. This occurs when we have 2 sets of measurements (like our other examples), but each one from one set is related to a measure in the other set. For example, the same person is measured before and after taking a medication or after exercising.  By including this part of the experimental design in our tests, we reduce some of the noise in our data and thus make it easier to find difference among the measurements.  To do this, we'll use the same functions, but instead of using the formula interface we'll put in each group (like we did already for the bootstrapjsg function). For the t.test and wilcox.test functions, we'll add the argument paired = T.  For the sign test, 2 sample data must be paired, so you don't have to add the argument.     

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We'll practice the paired designs using data collected by a health professor to determine if freshmen really gain weight upon entering college (the freshmen 15).  New students were measured at the beginning of the semester and again 12 weeks later.  Download the data using weight <- read.table("https://dasl.datadescription.com/download/data/3218", header = T)
  CorrectAnswer: weight <- read.table("https://dasl.datadescription.com/download/data/3218", header = T)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='weight <- read.table("https://dasl.datadescription.com/download/data/3218", header = T)')
  Hint: Try weight <- read.table("https://dasl.datadescription.com/download/data/3218", header = T).
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: What is our null hypothesis?
  AnswerChoices: weight does not change over 12 weeks; weight does change over 12 weeks; not sure
  CorrectAnswer: weight does not change over 12 weeks
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='weight does not change over 12 weeks')
  Hint: Remember a null hypothesis is one of no difference!
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: First consider what happens if we don't pair the data by student.  When I ran the test (not shown here) I got a p-value of .65.  What does that suggest about the null hypothesis?
  AnswerChoices: reject; fail to reject; not sure
  CorrectAnswer: fail to reject
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='fail to reject')
  Hint: If the p-value is less than .05 (the pre-set alpha level), we reject the null hypothesis. This means we would expect an outcome like we observed or more extreme only 1 time out of 20 (on average) if the null hypothesis were true, so it's unlikely! If its more than that we fail to reject!
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now let's run a paired t-test by entering each column and noting paired = T. Try t.test(weight$Initial.Weight, weight$Terminal.Weight, paired = T).
  CorrectAnswer: t.test(weight$Initial.Weight, weight$Terminal.Weight, paired = T)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='t.test(weight$Initial.Weight, weight$Terminal.Weight, paired = T)')
  Hint: Try t.test(weight$Initial.Weight, weight$Terminal.Weight, paired = T).
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Now find the p-value. What does it suggest about the null hypothesis?
  AnswerChoices: reject; fail to reject; not sure
  CorrectAnswer: reject
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='reject')
  Hint: If the p-value is less than .05 (the pre-set alpha level), we reject the null hypothesis. This means we would expect an outcome like we observed or more extreme only 1 time out of 20 (on average) if the null hypothesis were true, so it's unlikely! If its more than that we fail to reject!
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: So by running a paired test we got a significant result!  The assumptions for the paired t-test rely on normality of the differenes in the means of the data.  If we don't think this is true and the data sets have the same shape, we can use wilcox.test(weight$Initial.Weight, weight$Terminal.Weight, paired = T). Try it.
  CorrectAnswer: wilcox.test(weight$Initial.Weight, weight$Terminal.Weight, paired = T)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='wilcox.test(weight$Initial.Weight, weight$Terminal.Weight, paired = T)')
  Hint: Try wilcox.test(weight$Initial.Weight, weight$Terminal.Weight, paired = T). 
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: You should have found a p-value of less than .01 again (check!). Finally, if we don't believe the data sets have the same shape, we can use the SIGN.test function from the BSDA package. These tests have to be paired so they don't require paired = T argument. Load the package and try SIGN.test(weight$Initial.Weight, weight$Terminal.Weight).
  CorrectAnswer: SIGN.test(weight$Initial.Weight, weight$Terminal.Weight)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='SIGN.test(weight$Initial.Weight, weight$Terminal.Weight)')
  Hint: Try SIGN.test(weight$Initial.Weight, weight$Terminal.Weight).
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: You should get a p-value much less than .01 again! However, note the sign and wilcoxon tests in general have less power than the t-test (but they also make less assumptions about the data. What is power?
  AnswerChoices: ability of a test to reject a false null hypothesis; ability of a test to not reject a true null hypothesis; 
  CorrectAnswer: ability of a test to reject a false null hypothesis
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='ability of a test to reject a false null hypothesis')
  Hint: A powerful test is able to reject a false null hypothesis!
  
- Class: text
  Output: This concludes our review of analyzing two-sample continuous data.  Note we got similar results from many methods, but the assumptions and p-values (or lack thereof!) differ. Make sure you understand why! Also make sure you understand when data should be paired!
